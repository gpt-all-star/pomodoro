# Pomodoro Timer - Client-Side Web Application Specification

## 1. Timer Functionality
The application should incorporate a countdown timer that is able to count down from a set amount of time (in minutes and seconds) to zero.

## 2. Set Time
The user should have the ability to set the timer for a 25-minute work period. This is in alignment with the traditional Pomodoro technique where each work period, also known as a Pomodoro, is 25 minutes long.

## 3. Break Time
After each work period, the application should automatically set a timer for a 5-minute break period. This is also part of the Pomodoro technique where short breaks are taken after each Pomodoro.

## 4. Start, Pause, and Reset Buttons
The application's user interface should include:
- A 'Start' button to begin the countdown.
- A 'Pause' button to temporarily halt the countdown.
- A 'Reset' button to revert the countdown back to its initial value.

## 5. Audio/Visual Alert
The application should alert the user when the countdown reaches zero. This could be an audio alert, a visual alert, or both.

## 6. Responsive Design
The application's design should be responsive, allowing it to function effectively on devices with different screen sizes.

## 7. User-friendly Interface
The application's user interface should be simple and intuitive, allowing users to easily navigate and use the application without confusion.

## 8. Compatibility
The application should be compatible with all major web browsers to ensure a broad user base.
