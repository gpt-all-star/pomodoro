# Pomodoro Timer Web Application Specification

## Overview
The application is a client-side web application implementing a Pomodoro Timer. 

## User Interface
The application must have a clean and user-friendly interface. The primary feature on the screen should be a digital timer.

## Timer Functionality
The digital timer should be programmable for a 25-minute work session. This is the standard Pomodoro technique time. 

## Breaks
After each Pomodoro (25-minute work session), there should be an automatic start of a 5-minute break session.

## Long Breaks
After four consecutive Pomodoros, there should be an automatic start of a 15-minute break session. 

## Start/Stop Functionality
The user should be able to control the timer with start, pause, and stop commands.

## Sound Notifications
There should be sound notifications to signal the transition between work and break sessions.

## Session Counter
The application should have a session counter, displaying the number of completed Pomodoros.

## Future Considerations
While the above specifications will satisfy the MVP, future enhancements can be considered based on user feedback and client preferences. These may include task tracking, statistics, customization options for timer length, and UI themes.

## Conclusion
This specification provides an outline for a basic Pomodoro Timer web application. The implementation details will need to be fleshed out by the development team based on these specifications.
